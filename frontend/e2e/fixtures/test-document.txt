Introduction to Physics

Chapter 1: Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):
An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

Newton's Second Law:
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is expressed as F = ma.

Newton's Third Law:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Key Concepts:
- Force: A push or pull on an object
- Mass: The amount of matter in an object
- Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity
- Inertia: The tendency of an object to resist changes in motion

Examples:
1. A ball rolling on a flat surface will continue rolling until friction stops it
2. Pushing a heavy box requires more force than pushing a light box
3. When you jump, you push the Earth down and the Earth pushes you up

Practice Problems:
1. Calculate the force needed to accelerate a 10 kg object at 5 m/sÂ²
2. If a 50 N force is applied to a 25 kg object, what is its acceleration?
3. Explain why passengers lurch forward when a car brakes suddenly
