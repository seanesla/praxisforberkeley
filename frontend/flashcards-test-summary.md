## ❌ Issues Found

### 1. **Backend API Connection**
- API routes returning 404 despite server running
- Document creation endpoint not accessible
- Flashcard generation endpoint not reachable
- Authentication works but other routes fail

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- Middleware redirects unauthenticated users correctly
- But authenticated API calls still fail with 404

### 3. **Next.js Build Issues**
- Missing auth page files causing build errors
- Static assets returning 404 in some cases

## 📸 Screenshots

1. **Working Flashcard UI** - Shows the flashcards interface with all elements
2. **Card Flipped State** - Answer visible with rating buttons
3. **Navigation Working** - Second card displayed with progress updated
4. **Auth Page** - Login form displays correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Backend Routes**: Investigate why API routes return 404 despite being mounted
2. **Fix Auth Pages**: Add missing login/register pages to resolve build errors
3. **Test Real Features**: Once API is fixed, test:
   - Document upload and parsing
   - AI flashcard generation
   - Spaced repetition algorithm
   - Database persistence
   - Real-time updates

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Run flashcard tests
npx playwright test e2e/flashcards-final-test.spec.ts --headed

# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Test API routes
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/flashcards/generate/123
```

## Conclusion

The flashcards UI is fully functional with working flip animations, navigation, and visual design. The main blocker is the backend API connection issue preventing real flashcard generation and persistence. Once the API routes are fixed, all features should work as designed.
