## Inspiration
In a world overflowing with powerful productivity tools, we found a strange paradox: the most feature-rich note-taking apps like Notion and Obsidian often come with a steep learning curve that alienates beginners. Users are forced to choose between overwhelming complexity and simplistic, uninspired design.
We asked: Why can't a note-taking app be both powerful and intuitive? Why can't it adapt to how we think, instead of forcing us to adapt to it?
Praxis is our answer. It's designed to be the ultimate thinking tool, a smart canvas that helps you transform theory into practice. It connects your ideas, grounds your research, and even talks back to you, all through a beautifully simple interface.

## What It Does
Praxis is a next-generation, AI-powered note-taking application designed for deep thinking and effortless learning. It seamlessly integrates several key innovations:

### Core Features

#### üéØ Unified Workspace
No more hunting through tabs or complex navigation. Praxis features a revolutionary unified workspace where everything is accessible through:
- **Command Palette (‚åòK)**: Natural language commands to navigate anywhere instantly
- **Smart Activity Feed**: Your recent work and AI-powered suggestions in one place
- **Floating AI Assistant**: Always-available help without leaving your current task

#### ‚ú® Instant Context Retrieval
The flagship feature that makes Praxis magical. As you write in Smart Notes:
- AI quietly monitors your typing patterns
- When you pause, relevant content from your documents appears as ghost text
- Press Tab to accept suggestions, keep typing to ignore
- Source attribution shows exactly where information comes from
- No popups or interruptions - just the right information at the right moment

#### üß† Grounded AI & Source-Based Learning
Eliminate AI hallucinations and get trustworthy answers. Our "Grounded AI" feature restricts the AI's knowledge base to only the documents you provide. Ask complex questions and get perfectly accurate, cited answers in seconds.

#### üéôÔ∏è Interactive "Podcast Mode"
Your notes are no longer static. Engage in a real-time conversation with your personal AI about your documents and ideas. Use it to study for a test, rehearse a presentation, or explore a topic from a new perspective.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Visual-First Thinking (Interactive Mind Maps)
Don't just write notes‚Äîsee them. Praxis can instantly transform your documents or brainstormed lists into interactive, aesthetically pleasing mind maps, helping you find hidden connections and grasp complex topics at a glance.

## Philosophy

Praxis is built on three core principles:

1. **Features should be invisible until needed, powerful when used**
   - No feature bloat or overwhelming interfaces
   - Progressive disclosure based on user needs
   - Every feature must solve a real problem

2. **AI should augment, not automate thinking**
   - Instant Context Retrieval helps you write better, not write for you
   - Suggestions come from your own knowledge base
   - You remain in control of your ideas

3. **Complexity should be hidden, not simplified away**
   - Powerful features accessible through natural language
   - Advanced capabilities that don't require advanced knowledge
   - Depth available for power users, simplicity for beginners
