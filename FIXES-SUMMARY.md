# Authentication and Navigation Fixes Summary

## Date: June 22, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Missing `/api/auth/me` Endpoint (500 Error)
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/auth/me` but the endpoint didn't exist.

**Solution**: Added the `/me` endpoint to auth routes:
- Returns current user information
- Checks for user profile in `users` table
- Falls back to auth user data if no profile exists

**File Changed**: `/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

#### 2. ✅ User Profile Creation on Registration
**Problem**: Registration only created auth user, not user profile.

**Solution**: Added automatic user profile creation:
- Creates entry in `users` table after successful auth registration
- Includes full_name from registration form
- Continues even if profile creation fails (auth user still exists)

**File Changed**: `/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

#### 3. ✅ Document Upload Page 404 Error
**Problem**: Quick Actions linked to `/documents/upload` but page was created at `/dashboard/documents/upload`.

**Solution**: 
- Created document upload page at `/app/dashboard/documents/upload/page.tsx`
- Fixed navigation paths in QuickActions component
- Beautiful drag-and-drop interface with file type validation

**Files Changed**: 
- `/frontend/components/QuickActions.tsx` (fixed paths)
- `/frontend/app/dashboard/documents/upload/page.tsx` (new page)

#### 4. ✅ Mind Map Navigation Path
**Problem**: Quick Actions pointed to `/mindmaps/new` instead of `/dashboard/mindmaps/new`.

**Solution**: Updated the path in QuickActions component.

**File Changed**: `/frontend/components/QuickActions.tsx`

#### 5. ✅ Import Path Errors
**Problem**: Flashcards API was importing from wrong path.

**Solution**: Fixed import path from `'./client'` to `'../api'`.

**File Changed**: `/frontend/lib/api/flashcards.ts`

### Test Results

All fixes have been verified with E2E tests:
- ✅ Authentication working (no more 500 errors)
- ✅ Document upload page accessible and functional
- ✅ Navigation paths corrected
- ✅ No console errors
